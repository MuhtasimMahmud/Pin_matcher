PIN MATCHER

- This is just a simple function just like an OTP checker. In many websites we see that for verification, system send an OTP to our phone and we have to give that OTP to the website. If OTP matched only then we can get access to our account in that website. I made a function just like this checking system. To make this I used HTML, CSS and a bit JavaScript.

How it works? 
  - Firstly, you have to click on the “generate pin” button. Then in the text box it will generate a pin and then you have to type the same pin in the text box of right part and have to click submit button. If your pin matched then it will show success, otherwise it will show wrong pin. You can submit pin 3 times. If you give wrong pin consecutive 3 times then the submit option will disappear.
